          Codecademy to change my career from being a French translator to
          becoming a Web Developer!

        Here, you'll find the links to a selection of web pages I created during
        my Frontend Engineer training journey. Some are assignments from the
        Codecademy course, some are personal projects I built on my own for
        further practise.

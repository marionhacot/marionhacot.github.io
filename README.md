# Welcome to my Portfolio's page on GitHub!

## Usage

I created this page to showcase some of the projects I have been working on to put into practice the skills learned while following Codecademy's [Frontend Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/front-end-engineer).

## Technologies

All projects are based on HTML5 and CSS3. Some use JavaScript as well for interaction.
All webpages are responsive to adjust for smartphone viewers as well as desktop screens.

## Notes

This page will grow as I progress on my journey to becoming a Frontend Engineer!
